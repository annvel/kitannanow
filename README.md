This is a performing musical artist website created from 13th February, 2023 1700 hours.

The aim at first is to design a landing page (home page) that showcases all the works of the artist - Kitanna, ranging from her music, a shop for her fans to buy her merchandise, her music videos and latest news from her to her fans.

At first, the languages that will be used for this project will be HTML and CSS but the website will be updated gradually with other languages to give the website visitors the best experience.

At this specific period of the project, no relative links will be working but will be updated as the project grows and as I learn more about web development.

The project will be stored in github and all edits will be committed using git.
